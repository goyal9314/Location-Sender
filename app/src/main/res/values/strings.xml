    <string name="app_description">Send Location lets you easily share your location during potentially dangerous circumstances.
    \n\nYou are required to select one of your contacts as the contact to whom the distress message is to be sent. You can change this contact at any time.
    \n\nTo send a distress message, click on \'Send location as SMS\' button and choose one of the two modes - Single SMS mode or Continuous Location Update. In Continuous Location Update mode, an SMS with your latest location will be sent every minute until you choose to stop.
    \n\nOnce location is received by Send Location, the map is set. It is recommended to send the location after the map is set, as your location will be included as a Google Maps link in the SMS. If location could not be determined, only a distress message is sent, without the link.
    \n\nIf your chosen contact has Send Location installed in their device, a distress alarm is played upon receiving a distress message. This applies even for the SMS without location data.
